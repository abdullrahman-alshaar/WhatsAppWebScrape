# WhatsAppWebScrape
This project automates the extraction of contact information (phone numbers and saved names) from WhatsApp Web using Python, Selenium, and BeautifulSoup. It is designed to tackle the challenge of collecting contact data from a large number of chats (up to 5,000), which would be extremely time-consuming and error-prone if done manually.
